# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML
                                    ABSTRACT 

In today's interconnected world, the proliferation of fake news poses a significant
challenge to the integrity of information dissemination. The ability to discern between
genuine and fabricated news articles is crucial for maintaining public trust and
safeguarding democratic processes. This project focuses on developing and evaluating a
machine learning (ML) model for fake news detection, aiming to provide a reliable tool
for automated verification of news authenticity. 

The project employs a diverse dataset comprising labelled news articles collected from 
various sources, encompassing a wide range of topics and styles. In addition to
 individual algorithm performance, ensemble learning methods, such as random forests 
and gradient boosting, are investigated to further enhance the model's predictive
 capability and resilience to noise in the data. Comparative analyses are conducted to 
assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of computational 
efficiency and classification accuracy.
The developed model demonstrates promising results in accurately identifying fake
news articles, thereby offering a practical solution to mitigate the adverse effects of
misinformation on society. By providing a scalable and automated approach to fake
news detection, this project contributes to efforts aimed at fostering a more informed
and resilient public discourse in the digital age. Overall, this research underscores the
importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, linguistics,
and journalism to address the complex challenges posed by fake news. Future directions
include exploring real-time detection strategies, incorporating multimedia content
analysis, and integrating social network analysis techniques to enhance the robustness
and applicability of the proposed model in diverse information ecosystems.
The objective of this project is to examine the problems and possible significances related with the spread of fake news. We will be working on different fake news data set in which we will apply different machine learning algorithms to train the data and test it to find which news is the real news or which one is the fake news. As the fake news is a problem that is heavily affecting society and our perception of not only the media but also facts and opinions themselves. By using the artificial intelligence and the machine learning, the problem can be solved as we will be able to mine the patterns from the data to maximize well defined objectives. So, our focus is to find which machine learning algorithm is best suitable for what kind of text dataset. Also, which dataset is better for finding the accuracies as the accuracies directly depends on the type of data and the amount of data. The more the data, more are your chances of getting correct accuracy as you can test and train more data to find out your results.
